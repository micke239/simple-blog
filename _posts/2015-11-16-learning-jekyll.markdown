## Installing

I just installed Jekyll for the first time, thinking that a static site generator would fit perfectly for what I'm about to do.

It was all very simple, I had everything needed already installed on my system. Except of Jekyll, of course.

So after a `gem install jekyll`, followed by `jekyll new blog`, I had a bootstrap application which I could serve and buil using `jekyll serve --detach` and `jekyll build --watch`.

## Configuring

So far, I've touched the `config.yml` file and the includes. The only issue I've come across so far is that I have to redo `jekyll serve` and `jekyll watch` each time I edit the configs. I'm eager to learn more!
